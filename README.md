# NLP-Group-Assignment-Customer-Support-on-Twitter (Giorgi Chachava and Sandor Varsanyi)
This GitHub repository documents the work and outcomes of our group NLP project in this semester and serves as the primary link required in the final report, and the seminar leader has been granted access for assessment. 

## Objective
The objective is to address a real-ife NLP problem with actual business relevance using a self-selected dataset.
The core focus of the project is the implementation, comparison and performance evaluation of various NLP modeling and search approaches. 

## What has been done? 

* **Data exploration and preparation**
  * We performed a brief data exploration to gain understanding baout our selected datset
  * We carried out the necessary data preparation task (cleaning, tokenization, formatting, for the relevenat modeling phase
    
* Model **Comparative analysis**
  * We implemented a classical machine learning models as a baseline *(Logistic regression and TF-idf)**
  * Then we implemented a neural model -> our selection became the **Bert-Model**
  * Finally we tested the promting based approaches using **LLMs**.
 
  * We carried out a comparative analysis based on model accuracy.
 

## Delivarables

* A PDF report that details the following points:
  * The chosen task and dataset
  * The metholdolgy and experimental setup
  * The reults from the model comparions and search engine evaluations.
  * The business relevance of the project and recommendations
